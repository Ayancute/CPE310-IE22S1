I'm Mariane Alcantara, a BSIE student. I love playing games. I judge a game based on the looks of it and how it progresses. I'm interested in games that are more adventure-like, like Genshin Impact, Wuthering Waves, Honkai: Star Rail, and Roblox. I enjoy listening to music; my current favorites right now are "I Saw Your Face Today" by She & Him and "Who Knows" by Daniel Caesar and Alexandra by The Reality Club. I also enjoy playing badminton, but now I rarely play because my schedule does not fit. I also enjoy reading fanfictions.

My expectation on this subject is that it will be hard since I type slowly and I don't have any coding experience, so it will be difficult for me. I didn't take C++, so I really don't have any knowledge about coding at all, but I am willing to learn.
